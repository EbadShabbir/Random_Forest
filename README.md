## Overview

The project uses the **Random Forest Algorithm** to classify users as buyers or non-buyers based on:
- **Age**
- **Estimated Salary**

The model is trained on a labeled dataset and evaluated for accuracy. Results are visualized for both the training and testing sets.

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

Install them using:


`pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn`


### Instructions for Usage:
- Replace `path/to/training_visualization.png` and `path/to/test_visualization.png` with the paths to your generated images if you save them as files.
- Include the `.csv` dataset in the same directory as your script or adjust the path accordingly.
